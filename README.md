# Launch-Mission-Controller-with-p5

Launch-Mission-Controller is software that manages countdown such as high altitude balloon while playing music with SonicPi.
By writing a time stamp in the CSV file, it will automatically read the mission periodically by speech synthesis.
This program works with processing. And to communicate with SonicPi using OSC, you need oscp5 and texttospeech libraries.
